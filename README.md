*Answering the second question i needed to split the employees full names into first name and last name using the text to column function located in the data tab,had to also create another column to accomodate it after spliting using space as the delimeter.then i also used the conditional formatting to look out for duplicates on my data set and i found out one of the employees names was entered twice so i highlighted as instructed hence would have deleted the duplicates using the remove duplicates function found under data tab.

*For the last activity i used conditional formatting to highlight Employees whose names starts with letter E and highlighted in yellow ,then went ahead to sort the salary column using sort and filter once again on the home tab to enable me highlight the highest salary in green background and the lowest salary in red background using the condtional formatting highlighting rules, sorting with the top 1 for the highest salary and bottom 1 for the lowest salary.
